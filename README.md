API for playing Abalone

I'm trying to make an API for playing abalone 
(see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abalone_(board_game) for questions on the game).
For the moment only the two-player mode is available, with Split (known as 'Belgian daisy starting position') or Normal version.
You can for the moment undo moves, restart a game, quit, choose the version of the next game.
Other operations will be updated as soon as possible : computer mode, historic of games, and online game with friends. 

Enjoy your games
